Each Chart Pane and Indicator has a legend. It is also possible (TODO:) to add a legend to an Overlay. 
Legends display information provided by their host component. 
They also allow modification of their host component via the chart GUI.

The legend control icons become visible when hovering over the legend with pointer.
