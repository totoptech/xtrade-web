# Currently implemented indicators

More indicators will be implemented. The plan is that the chart will ship with a select few or none, and the bundle of indicators published as an extension to the chart, allowing you to selectively import the indicators that you require, rather than all at once.

Read the [indicators](../indicators/) to learn how to use them on your chart.
