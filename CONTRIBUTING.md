## Reporting issues

We only accept issues that are bug reports or feature requests. Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that can be fixed within the Hammer.js.
Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1. [**Read the documentation**](https://github.com/tradex-app/TradeX-chart/blob/master/docs/documentation.md) (work in progress)

2. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.** Be sure the problem exists in the TradeX code with a reduced test case that should be included in each bug report.

3. **Include a live example.** Make use of CodeSandbox, jsFiddle, jsBin, or the like  to share your isolated test cases. Also, a screen capture would work, with tools like LICEcap.

4. **Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system and version, browser and version, version of Hammer.js, customized or vanilla build, etc. where appropriate. Also include steps to reproduce the bug.

## Pull requests

1. Changes must be done in `/src` files, never just the compiled files. Also, don't commit the compiled files.

2. Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes. Keep them simple and small

3. Try to share which browsers your code has been tested in before submitting a pull request

4. Write tests for your code, these can be found in `/tests`.
